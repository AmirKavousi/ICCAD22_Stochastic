\section{EMSpice2 Simulator}
  \label{sec:emspice}
The whole EM check flow, similar to EMSpice, mainly consists of four major
steps: the power grid generation step from the EDA tool
(Synopsys ICC), EM immortality filtering by considering joule heating effects, temperature-aware
FDTD EM solver and linear network IR drop solver, and the EM check
framework GUI. In the power grid generation step, the power
grid information is constructed from Synopsys IC Compiler
(ICC) during the physical synthesis process for a specific
design. After this, the power gird and corresponding
branch current are first passed to the temperature-aware EM immortality
filter step (to be discussed in Section ??). Immortal trees are
filtered out since they will never fail and resistance of these
trees will never change. After this step, all the mortal trees
are passed to the coupled solver step. The coupled solver consists
of the temperature-aware FDTD for EM stress solver and linear network
IR drop solver. In this step, hydrostatic stress on these mortal tree wires will
be simulated accelerated by 60x using MOR and void position and volume size will be calculated all by considering thermomigration effects.
All this information will then be passed to the EM check
framework graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive user
analysis.
